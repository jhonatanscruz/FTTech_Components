# [FTTech_Components Arduino Library](https://github.com/jhonatanscruz/FTTech_Components)

Arduino library to make FTTECH equipments control easier. Examples supports the FTTech SAMD51 Click boards

Currently supports the following hardware:

* Stepper Motor;
* Rotary encoder with 3 outputs(A, B, Z).
* Rotary encoder with 2 outputs(A, B).

## News

* 1.4.1 Minor changes on "FT_Encoder2" class.
* 1.4 New "FT_Encoder2" class to control a rotary encoder with 2 outputs (A, B)
* 1.3 New "Reset()" function in FT_Encoder class to reset encoder position.
* 1.2 New "FT_Encoder" class to control a rotary encoder with 3 outputs (A, B, Z) and its example "Encoder_example".
* 1.1.1 New "Reset()" function in "FT_Stepper" class to reset motor position.
* 1.1 Default direction of stepper rotation fixed to clockwise direction.
* 1.0 New "FT_Stepper" class to control a stepper motor and its example "RunTo".
* Initial Release
